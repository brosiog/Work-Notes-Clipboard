# Work-Notes-Clipboard
A static and editable clipboard to keep your notes organized and handy! Written by Ambrosio Gomez 2025

Uses Winforms for the GUI, so this program only works on Windows!

SETUP:
1. Download the files and put them in a folder
2. Create a shortcut to open and run the source code using this script C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -WindowStyle Hidden -File "/path/to/your/folder/" (This will run the ps1 file with powershell, while automatically hiding the terminal)
3. Your program should work! Any changes to the settings/layout will be stored in JSON files in the folder where the source code is
